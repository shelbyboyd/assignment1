        <p class="dropcap">John Singleton's portrayal of social problems in inner-city Los Angeles takes the form of a tale of three friends growing up together <em class="hood">in the hood.</em> Half-brothers Doughboy and Ricky Baker are foils for each other's personality, presenting very different approaches to the tough lives they face. Ricky is the <em>All-American</em> athlete, looking to win a football scholarship to USC and seeks salvation through sports, while <em>Dough</em> succumbs to the violence, alcohol, and crime surrounding him in his environment, but maintains a strong sense of pride and code of honor. Between these two is their friend Tre, who is lucky to have a father, 'Furious' Styles, to teach him to have the strength of character to do what is right and to always take responsibility for his actions.</p>

            <p>The movie’s hero, who will probably excel in college and in a profession, if he lives to get that far, is an intelligent 17-year-old named Tre Styles. As he grows into his teens, there is always the possibility that words will lead to insults, that insults will lead to a need to “prove his manhood,” that with guns everywhere, somebody will be shot dead.</p>

            <summary>Doughboy</summary>
            <p>Doughboy is not a bad person, but he is into booze and drugs and will sooner or later find bad trouble. He spends most of his days on the front steps, drinking, plotting, feeding his resentments.  He is a high-school dropout and a juvenile delinquent who never knew his father, and lives with his uncaring mother. He is street-smart, but aggressive. He earned his nickname for being overweight when he was little, but he lost some weight while in prison, and also became a Crips member.</p>

            <p> Ricky is the maternal half-brother of Doughboy. They both live at home, where it is no secret in the family that the mother prefers Ricky. He is an all-star football player at Crenshaw High School and Tre's best friend. He hopes to attend college as well, using a sports scholarship at the USC. He is naive and mostly under Doughboy's shadow. </p>
